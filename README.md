# Swiss-Weather-Data
R codes to match Swiss weather data with exact coordinates of farms/ fields

# Description

This repository contains R Scripts that extract weather data provided by MeteoSwiss for exact coordinates (e.g. farm or field coordinates). 
There are scripts for gridded datasets (for extrapolated weather data) and scripts for station data will be publsihed soon.
You need to know either the exact coordinates (e.g. in GPS or Swiss coordinates), ZIP-codes or BFS-numbers (unique municipality identifier).
Choose the R script that corresponds to your data availability (exact coordinates, ZIP-code, BFS-number). Note that you need the BFS-numbers of 2021 (i.e. municipality-mergers should have the BFS-number of January 2021).
